# Route_Finder

Given csv files on airports and various airline routes on the globe, that are available for use, the Route_Finder should be able to connect all the files to return the user routes they can use to get to their desired destination.
If no such route exists that connects the user's origin t their destination, it returns None.
This project was written in C++ and is still being improved on to leverage on the unique aspect of pointers that only C++ can provide. 
You can make reference to the Java code equivalence under ICP_PROJECT.
